<h1>Report</h1>
<p>The goal of the restaurant webpage was to make a clean and simple sushi restaurant page where you have easy access to the restaurant’s menu.<br>
    I was planning on making the webpage easy to navigate with all information easily accessible.<br>
    So, the website was going to be easy to navigate with the navigation bar on top Where you can see all the content of the site on the top of the site.<br>
    Then it hit you with the name of the restaurant and the “allergener”.<br>
    The biggest part of the page is the menu how where all the food is it's big and easy to read and you can search with the keyboard for easy accessibility.<br> 
    Under the menu is the about page where you can read a little bit about the restaurant.<br>
    The plan was having a review there too but we got cut short in time.<br>
    And all the way down at the bottom of the page youcanbook the restaurant they can see the opening hours and the contact information. on the last version there's a hyperlink to the report page.<br>
    After doing the accessibility checker, we have two known problems. It says add text to the label element I honestly didn't understand it so I didn't make any changes. the only changes is with the report page.<br>
    In the folder images, is pictures of accessibility checker and html/css validator.
    I had a little problem with github, but i hope it is fine now.<br>
    Please contact me if the webpage looks weird on github.
